# Take a Hike

This app allows users to generate accounts, share and browse trails, and save trails to a page to view later.

Check it out here: https://take-a-hike.onrender.com/


## Getting started

You can sign in with a pre-made user, or create your own. If you create your own, at the moment there is no email verification, so you can use a completely made-up email address. dobby@hogwarts.com will work. If you'd like to use a pre-made one, you can use this:
username: hiker
email: hiker@hiker.com
pw: parks

Browse the trails that other users have already added or add your own trail. You can also edit or delete anything you've added, but you can't edit or delete trails other users have added.
Once you click delete it's gone forever, so only delete it if you're sure.
Click on each trail to save it to your wishlist using the like button. You can view your wishlist and remove trails, this will remove them from your wishlist but you can always add them again.


### Technologies used

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, PostgreSQL, express.js, node.js


### Future features
further updates will include the following:
- more information when clicking into individual trails
- a much more visually appealing 'like' button that will appear differently if the trail has already been liked by the user
- up to 3 photos can be uploaded for each trail, with just the main photo appearing when viewing the home page/wishlist
- able to upload files from a computer instead of a URL link
